Project: Brain MRI Tumor Segmentation (Otsu vs Sauvola)

Objective:
Segment tumor regions in brain MRI images using classical thresholding techniques.

Methods:

Otsu Thresholding (Global Thresholding)

Sauvola Thresholding (Adaptive Thresholding)

Evaluation Metrics:

Dice Score

Jaccard Index

Dataset:
Kaggle — Brain MRI Tumor Dataset

Key Findings:
Both global and adaptive thresholding methods struggle to accurately segment tumors due to intensity overlap between tumor and normal brain tissues.
